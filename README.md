**Description**

Nontrivial data analysis problems are frequently encountered in modern astronomy, cosmology and physics. They require an understanding of statistical methods, practical skills with software tools and sometimes some ingenuity that comes with experience. The student will gain a practical knowledge of statistical methods and software as applied to many example problems. Basic probability theory will be covered before learning about Bayesian and frequentest inference problems, Monte Carlo techniques, Fisher matrices, random fields, parameter estimation, non-parametric tests, hypothesis testing, and supervised and unsupervised classification and regression problems. The student will become familiar with current software in Python for analysing data and fitting models while getting an understanding of the theory behind them.

The laboratory part of the course will start with a general introduction to python, if needed, and then cover the libraries by numpy and scikit through example projects. The lab will follow the lecture material with practical examples.

Lecture topics:

1. Fundimental properties of probability

2. Random Variables

3. Classic probability distributions

4. Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection

5. Frequentist hypotheses testing

6. Fisher matrices

7. Non-parametric tests

8. Random Fields

9. Image reconstruction and map making

10. Numerical methods for the Bayesian Inference problem

11. supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods for classification.
