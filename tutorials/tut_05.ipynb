    "In this tutorial we will learn how to read data from a fits file, fit a spectrum to a series of templates and determine the spectrographic redshift of a galaxy.\n",

    "When assigning redshifts to galaxies with a full observed spectrum, one typically fits model spectra for the rest-frame galaxy spectrum to the observed one while accounting for the redshift of the wavelengths. In this challenge, we first want to try to fit a local spectrum with templates using a linear regression and least-squares before trying to estimate the redshift of a redshifted spectrum."
