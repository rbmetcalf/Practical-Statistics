    "**Tutorial 4 - Linear Regession on Galaxy Spectra with Templates**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will learn how to read data from a fits file, fit a spectrum to a series of templates and determine the spectrographic redshift of a galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When assigning redshifts to galaxies with a full observed spectrum, one typically fits model spectra for the rest-frame galaxy spectrum to the observed one while accounting for the redshift of the wavelengths. In this challenge, we first want to try to fit a local spectrum with templates using a linear regression and least-squares before trying to estimate the redshift of a redshifted spectrum."

You can look at the contents of it with hdul.info().  The templates we want are in the second table - templates[1].data.  There are 5 templates with each one having 27330 wavelengths so this will be a 27330 x 5 array.  The wavelengths that correspond to the pixels are in the templates[11].data.  The other tables contain templates with and without smoothing, dust, lines, etc.  You can look at them if you wish. Print the header information for the second table."
