    "In this tutorial we will do some Bayesian model checking on the type Ia supernovae data that we used in tutorial 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object of this exercise is to see if the data is consistent with the cosmological and statistical model we have been using to find the best fit parameters.  These assumptions could be wrong in any of a number of ways.  For example, the errors in the distance moduli are not Gaussian or not measured correctly, the cosmological model we are assuming is incorrect or the observed redshifts which we have treated as independent variable have significant errors in them.  We might wonder if the cosmological model we have assume which has no curvature (flat) and a cosmological constant is too simple.  Might there be evidence that the cosmological constant is evolving?
