<p>If you would like to install python on your computer I recommend installing <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos">Anaconda</a>.  It also has a simple a simple jupyter notebooks editor that works in a browser.  </p>
<p>However, I recommend editing and running jupyter notebooks with microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a>.  You can also run notebooks in google&#39;s <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Colab</a> which requires not installation or notebooks.</p>
<p>On the UNIBO system you need to:</p>
<p>From the command line in your home directory:</p>
<p>1) install jupyter</p>
<pre><code>pip install jupyter --user
</code></pre><p>2) Make an alias for jupyter so that you don&#39;t need to type in the path every time you start it.</p>
<p>Create and open this file</p>
<pre><code>pico ~/.bash_aliases
</code></pre><p>In the pico editor add the line</p>
<pre><code>alias jupyter=&#39;~/.local/bin/jupyter&#39;
</code></pre><p>and then save the file. (Ctr-x)</p>
<p>Now you need to re-source your .bashrc file.  Type </p>
<pre><code>source .bashrc
</code></pre><p>If all went well you should be able to start with jupyter:</p>
<pre><code>jupyter notebook
</code></pre></body></html>
